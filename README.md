# Recommendation System with UI

This is the setup for the local UI of our content-based music retrieval system. 

# Setup

Install the required packages into the virtual environment.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application.

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

For deploying it publicly we used the destkop version of streamlit, and created the "app".
It was connected to this GitHub repository.
